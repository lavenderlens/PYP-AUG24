Day 3 Quiz
----------

1. In function parameters,
*args packs n number of positional arguments into a _____tuple ? 
**kwargs packs n number of named arguments into a _____dict ?

2. Which of the two functions below has a closure? Note that both functions compile and run. 

def outer_a():
    lst = []
    def add_to_lst(item):
        nonlocal lst
        lst.append(item)
        return lst
    return add_to_lst

lst = []
def outer_b():
    def add_to_lst(item):
        global lst
        lst.append(item)
        return lst
    return add_to_lst

3. How does one access the attributes and methods of an object?
my_object = MyClass("Martin") #self.name = name
my_object.

4. Class names should be in what style?
CamelCase

5. Which dunder method is called (indirectly) when you FIRST create an object of a class?
__init__(self):

6. The first param. of each method in a class is conventionally named self. To what does this param. refer?
The current object under construction which will eventually be referenced by a global variable

7. How many objects are created in the following 2 LOC?

class_a = ClassA()
class_b = class_a

just one - class_b "uses" or references class_a

8. Which dunder method should we override in our own custom classes to obtain a meaningful representation of our objects' properties, once we have made the object?
__str__

class_a = ClassA() #__str__(self): pass
class_b = class_a

print(class_a) #equivalent to
print(class_a.__str__()) #

9. Write a *list slice* to return a new list with every other (even) number from the following list:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
nums[1::2]
OR, by list comprehension to TEST each number for evenness
even_nums = [num for num in nums if num % 2 ==0]
this works for any sequence of numbers
nums2 = [3,2,4,1,1,1,4,5,6,8,22]

10. Using *list comprehension*, return a list from the same list, nums, with just the numbers 5 or less
less_than_5 = [num for num in nums if num <=5]
