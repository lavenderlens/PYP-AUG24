Pattern Matching
----------------
Pattern matching is the testing of a string to determine if it matches some pattern of characters
For example, an email address follows a pattern: n chars followed by @ followed by n chars followed by . etc.
Pattern matching is often used for validation but also for parsing data
A regular expression (regex) is a series of special characters that describes the pattern
There are many online tools to help you build patterns, e.g. regex101.com and regexr.com
The re module in the standard library may be used to do pattern matching
A bunch of signifiers are available to help construct regular expressions
They are super-specific eg.
w means ANY word series of characters
W means ANYTHING OTHER THAN a word series of characters
d means ANY digit character
D means ANYTHING OTHER THAN a digit characters
